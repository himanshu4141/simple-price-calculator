## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 3.1: Stripe Elements Integration (Week 1)
**Priority: Critical**

#### Frontend Tasks:
1. **Install Stripe Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/stripe-angular
   ```

   - Add comprehensive error handling for Stripe errors

3. **Checkout Form Enhancement**
   - Integrate Stripe Elements card input fields
   - Add payment method validation
   - Implement secure tokenization flow
   - Add loading states and user feedback

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Add Stripe publishable key to environment files
   - Configure test/production Stripe keys
   - Add payment processing feature flags

#### Backend Tasks:
1. **Stripe Client Implementation**
   - Create `StripeClient.scala` with payment processing logic
   - Add payment method validation and confirmation
   - Implement error handling for payment failures

2. **Enhanced Checkout Service**
   - Update `CheckoutService` to handle payment methods
   - Integrate with Chargebee-Stripe payment processing
   - Add payment confirmation and subscription activation

### Phase 3.2: Success/Failure User Experience (Week 2)
**Priority: High**

#### Success Flow:
1. **Payment Success Component**
   - Create order confirmation page
   - Display subscription details and billing information
   - Show payment receipt and confirmation number
   - Add next steps and account access instructions

2. **Order Details Display**
   - Comprehensive order summary
   - Subscription start date and billing cycle
   - Customer service contact information
   - Download/access instructions for purchased products

#### Failure Flow:
1. **Payment Failure Component**
   - Clear error messaging for different failure reasons
   - Retry payment option with preserved form data
   - Alternative payment method suggestions
   - Support escalation and contact information

2. **Error Recovery**
   - Preserve customer information on payment failure
   - Allow payment method changes and retry
   - Implement smart retry logic for transient failures
   - Add comprehensive error logging for debugging

### Phase 3.3: Webhook Infrastructure (Week 3)
**Priority: Medium**

#### Webhook Endpoints:
1. **Chargebee Webhooks**
   - `POST /api/webhooks/chargebee` endpoint
   - Subscription event processing (created, changed, cancelled)

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement webhook rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses

### Data Protection
- **Customer Data**: Secure storage in Chargebee
- **Payment Data**: Stored securely in Stripe
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail
- **Access Control**: Restricted access to payment data

## 📊 Success Metrics
