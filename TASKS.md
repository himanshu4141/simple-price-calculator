- **Payment Flow Complexity**: Coordinating Chargebee subscription creation with Stripe payment processing
- **Tax Calculation**: Ensuring accurate tax calculation across multiple currencies and jurisdictions

### Medium Risk Items  
- **API Performance**: Caching strategy effectiveness for pricing data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- **Mobile Experience**: Ensuring smooth checkout flow on mobile devices

### Mitigation Strategies
- Extensive testing in Chargebee test environment before production
- Implement comprehensive fallback mechanisms for all external API calls
- Mobile-first approach for checkout page development
- Staged rollout with feature flags for production deployment

## Notes & Considerations

### Development Notes
- All monetary calculations should use decimal precision to avoid floating-point errors
- Implement idempotency for all payment-related API calls
- Log all external API interactions for debugging and monitoring
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of new functionality

#### Tax Calculation Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Use mock tax service with configurable rates
  - US: Federal (0%) + State (varies, default 8.5%)
  - Canada: GST/HST (5-15% depending on province)
  - UK: VAT (20%)
  - Australia: GST (10%)
  - EU: VAT (varies by country, default 20%)
- **Phase 2**: Replace with real Avalara when sandbox is available
- **Feature Flag**: `USE_REAL_AVALARA` to switch between mock and real service

### Business Notes
- Remove PDF Enterprise from all frontend displays as it's no longer offered
- Ensure pricing display matches Chargebee configuration exactly (1-year terms)
- Maintain 3-year pricing from existing pricing-data.json file
- Consider user notification for any pricing changes during session
- Plan for future expansion to additional billing terms and promotional features
- **Hybrid Pricing Strategy**: 
  - **1-Year Terms**: Real-time pricing from Chargebee APIs
  - **3-Year Terms**: Static pricing from pricing-data.json file
  - Display both pricing options normally throughout the application
  - Allow price calculations and estimates for both terms
  - Redirect to sales contact (hi@test.com) at checkout for 3-year terms
  - Only process automated checkout for 1-year terms
