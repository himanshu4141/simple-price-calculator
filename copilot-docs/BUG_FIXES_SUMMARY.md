# Bug Fixes & Improvements Summary

## üêõ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Currency Dropdown Not Working on Pricing Page** ‚úÖ

```scss
::ng-deep app-currency-selector {
  .currency-dropdown {
    z-index: 9999 !important;
    position: absolute !important;
  }
  
  .dropdown-overlay {
    z-index: 9998 !important;
    position: fixed !important;
  }
}
