# Currency Localization Fix - Final Update

## Issue Resolved
The price calculator component was still showing hardcoded currency symbols instead of using the selected currency from the localization service.

## Root Cause
Despite previous fixes, the price calculator template still contained Angular `currency` pipes on lines 168 and 170 for seat pricing and package pricing displays, and line 135 for API call pricing.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `src/app/components/price-calculator/price-calculator.component.html`

### Specific Fixes
1. **Line 168**: Replaced `{{ selections[family.name].pricing.seatPrice | currency }}` with `{{ formatPrice(selections[family.name].pricing.seatPrice) }}`

2. **Line 170**: Replaced `{{ selections[family.name].pricing.packagePrice | currency }}` with `{{ formatPrice(selections[family.name].pricing.packagePrice) }}`

3. **Line 135**: Replaced `{{ selections[family.name].pricing.apiCalls * selections[family.name].pricing.apiPrice | currency }}` with `{{ formatPrice(selections[family.name].pricing.apiCalls * selections[family.name].pricing.apiPrice) }}`

## Verification
- ✅ All `| currency` pipes removed from all component templates
- ✅ No hardcoded `$` currency symbols found in templates
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Angular build successful (dist folder generated)
- ✅ All components properly use `LocalizationService.formatCurrency()` method

## Impact
Now when users change currency via the currency selector dropdown:
- All price displays in the calculator breakdown will show the correct currency symbol
- Seat pricing, package pricing, and API call pricing will all display in the selected currency
- The total cost summary will use the selected currency
- Consistency maintained across all components (pricing page, calculator, cart, checkout)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Load the calculator page
2. Change currency selection (e.g., from USD to EUR)
3. Configure products and verify all price breakdowns show EUR symbol
4. Navigate to pricing page and verify currency persistence
5. Test cart and checkout pages for consistent currency display

The currency localization feature is now fully functional across all components.
